Find the smallest feedback arc set in a directed graph. The smallest
feedback arc set problem is NP-hard, so the time needed to find the
solution grows quickly with the size of the graph, unless it has some
advantageous structure.

"""
    find_feedback_arc_set(graph)

Find the smallest feedback arc set for `graph`, which must be a
directed graph from the `Graphs` package.

    find_feedback_arc_set(graph; kwargs...)

By adding keyword arguments it is possible to guide the search or
obtain non-optimal solutions and bounds in shorter time than the full
solution.

*Keyword arguments:*

* `self_loops`: What to do with self-loops in the graph. The options
  are `"error"` to give an error, `"ignore"` to ignore them, or
  `"include"` to include them in the feedback arc set. The default is
  to give an error.

* `max_iterations`: Stop search after this number of iterations.
  Defaults to a very high number.

* `time_limit`: Stop search after this number of seconds. Defaults to
  a very high number.

* `solver`: IP solver. Currently `"cbc"` (default) and `"highs"` are
  supported.

* `solver_time_limit`: Maximum time to spend in each iteration to
  solve integer programs. This will be gradually increased if the IP
  solver does not find a useful solution in the allowed time. Defaults
  to 10 seconds.

* `log_level`: Amount of verbosity during search. 0 is maximally
  quiet. The default value 1 only prints progress for each iteration.
  Higher values add diagnostics from the IP solver calls.

* `iteration_callback`: A function provided here is called during each
  iteration. The function should take one argument which is a named
  tuple with diagnostic information, see the code for exact
  specifications. Return `true` to continue search and `false` to stop
  search. The default is the `print_iteration_data` function.

The return value is of the `FeedbackArcSet` type and contains the
following fields:

* `lower_bound`: Lower bound for feedback arc set.

* `feedback_arc_set`: Vector of the edges in the smallest found
  feedback arc set.

* `internals`: Dict containing a variety of information about the search.
